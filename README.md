# Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates

# The dataset I used describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolized with €) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

# If the exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar is 1.5, you get 1.5 US dollars if you pay 1.0 euro (one euro has more value than one US dollar at this exchange rate).

# Daria Chemkaeva put together the data set and made it available on Kaggle — the data source is the European Central Bank: https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020

# The objective of the project is to urdestand how the euro-dollar rate changed during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. I also showed the data for 2006 and 2009 for comparison.
